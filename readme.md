# Wallet API 🏦

This is just a test

## Overview 📝

The Wallet API provides endpoints for user management and tracking personal finances through
transactions. Users can register, login, view profile info, and log out. Once authenticated, they
can perform CRUD operations on transactions, filter transactions, and get aggregated data like total
income, expenses, and totals per category.
